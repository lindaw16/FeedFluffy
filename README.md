FeedFluffy
==========

An iOS App that I created with some friends for the iOS Game Design and Development competition over MIT's IAP:

Fluffy the Dragon is the newest addition to your zoo, and it is YOUR job to feed him! Rather than walking into the cage of a hungry beast, you, very smartly, decide to use your trusty cannon to aid you in this job. Adjust it by dragging it around or rotating the head and launch your cannonball to collect the fruits Fluffy wants and deliver them to him! But you only get one try! Magic cannon balls aren’t cheap you know. Still think it’s no problem? It won’t be quite that easy... there are bouncy boulders to block you and sneaky squirrels that steal… Sometimes the best path from you to Fluffy is not a straight line... you'll have to think outside the cage!

Some of the coolest levels to check out are:
1, 4, 11, 13.. and 12 if you want a challenge :)
